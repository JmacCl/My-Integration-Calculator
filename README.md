# My Integration Calculator
This is my attempt at making a integration calculator in python

I would like it to have basic interation abilities, like integrating single terms and siple exprestions like sinx or e^x

Eventually I would like it to be able to do more complex things such as integration by parts, integration by substituion. As well as adding other features like being able to 
integrate multiple variables, being able to integrate between two points, etc...

Thank you very much for reviewing my code :).
